# Flutter_Demo_1

Solve the tasks:

1. Create a new Flutter App (flutter create flutter_assignment, then replace your main.dart with the attached one) and output an AppBar and some text below it (i.e. in the body of the page)

2. Add a button (e.g. RaisedButton) which changes the text (to any other text of your choice)

3. Split the app into three custom widgets: App, TextControl & Text
